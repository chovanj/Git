# Hello NuGet!

This repository is created just for playing with NuGet.

***

Because nuget.exe is the command-line utility you have to install it manually.

1. Download required nuget.exe from [nuget.org/downloads](https://nuget.org/downloads).
2. Copy downloaded nuget.exe to c:\Program Files (x86)\NuGet.
3. Add the folder where you placed nuget.exe to your PATH environment variable.
